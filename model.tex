We consider a double auction market of $n+m$ participants.
$n$ out of the $n+m$ participants are sellers while the rest of $m$ participants are buyers.
Let $S=\{s_1,s_2,\ldots, s_n\}$ and $B=\{b_1,b_2,\ldots b_m\}$ be the set of all sellers and buyers.
Each seller $s_i\in S$ is holding a one-unit item and is willing to sell it at price no lower than $v^b_i$.
Each buyer $b_j\in B$ wants to purchase one item with price no more than $v^b_j$.
Every participant of the market is connected to some other participants forming a social network.
More precisely, every seller or buyer $x\in S\cup B$ can only communicate directly with its neighbors $r_x\subseteq (S\cup B\setminus \{x\})$.
