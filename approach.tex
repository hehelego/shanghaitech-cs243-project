Given the current model and prior works, we would like to design a novel double-auction mechanism
on social network that satisfies Individual Rational(IR), Incentive Compatible(IC) and Budget Balance(BB).
However, by Myerson-Satterthwaite theorem\cite{MYERSON1983265}, it's impossible to also guranteen the
Economic Efficiency(EE). Therefore, our mechanism will be slightly inefficient because it does not
guarantee that the buyer with a higher evaluation will always get the item.\par

The mechanism will then be subject to theoretical analysis of IR, IC and WB. Firstly, we will evaluate whether such properties does not hold by some small test cases. If such test cases are not found, we will try to give an exhaustive analysis of our mechanism with thorough proof. For EE, we will try to give a bound analysis to see how worse the social welfare can be compared to the most efficient one. In addition to theoretical analysis, we will evaluate the performance of the proposed mechanism in simulated settings based on empirical observations. These experiments will serve as a supplement to the theoretical analysis and will assist in validating the analytical properties.
