Given the current model and prior works, we would like to design a novel double-auction mechanism
on social network that satisfies Individual Rational(IR), Incentive Compatible(IC) and Budget Balance(BB).
However, by Myerson-Satterthwaite theorem\cite{MYERSON1983265}, it's impossible to also guranteen the
Economic Efficiency. Therefore, our mechanism will be slightly inefficient because it does not
guarantee that the buyer with a higher evaluation will always get the item.\par
After that, we will give an exhaustive analysis of our mechanism, with thorough proof on
IR, IC, and BB. For EE, we will try to give a bound analysis to see how worse the social welfare
can be compared to the most efficient one. If time permits, we will also simulate our mechanism.
