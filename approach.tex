Given the current model and prior works, we would like to design a novel double auction mechanism
on social network that satisfies Individual Rational(IR), Incentive Compatible(IC) and Budget Balance(BB).
However, by Myerson-Satterthwaite theorem[need cite], it's impossible to also guranteen the
Economic Efficiency. Therefore, our mechanism will be slightly inefficient since it will not
guranteen that the buyer with higher elvaluation will always get the item.\par
After that, we will give an exhaustive analysis of our mechanism, with thorogh proofs on
IR, IC, and BB. For EE, we will try to give a bound analysis, to see how worse the social warefare
can be compared to the most efficient one. If time permits, we will also carry out a simulation
of our mechanim.
